Food was scarce, friends and family were faraway, and luck was not on my side. Thrice I was bitten by a rabid wolf raised by the accursed goblins, and since then those wounds have gotten deeper. Only my magic had kept me alive."

			story = _ "Me, not a mage?! Surely you must be wrong. For I practice an art that many dare not to go into. Necromancy? That's for the cowardly. I practice the shadow magics, an arcane secret not known to many. It is that which empowers me."

			story = _ "I will not go back. I shall establish a new home here, in the Northlands! I have made acquaintances with the thugs here. Their leader, Addrevan, had contacted me, and we have raided goblin towns for food and gold. And many we have, that we have spread terror among the lesser orcs. This next one looks to be simple, as we have encountered practically no resistance. Makes me feel uneasy though, as there are rumors that a couple tribes have stashed away many gold coins here. It still feels strange, though..."
